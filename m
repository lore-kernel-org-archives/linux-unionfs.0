In addition to being read-only, I assume it's also unchanging?  I wonder
why you'd want to use NFS at all for this case--sharing a read-only
ext4-formatted block device would seem more straightforward.

Apologies if we've been through this before too, I've long ago paged out
any previous conversation....

In theory I suppose it's all possible, but I think the only practical
thing to do for now is just ignore NFSv4 ACLs.
