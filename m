Fair enough.  That's still pretty weird behavior.

Arguably if you're going to do something different here then maybe it's
good for the difference to manifest in a way that's really obvious in
common cases, so people don't just overlook it.

I suppose so.

Hm.  If inode_permission(realinode, mask) changes across copy-up: 

	- if the difference is in execute, you're telling me we'll
	  ignore that.
	- if it changes from denying to allowing read, you don't care
	  since that will prevent the copy up in the first place.
	- if it changes from denying to allowing write, that has no
	  effect since you only care about read permission for copyup in
	  the case someone requests write permission.  (Hm, the special
	  file case should be weird.  I guess those just don't get
	  copied up?  Still I think people will be surprised by
	  permission failures here.)
	- if it changes from allowing read or write to denying--then
	  we're no longer talking about root, assuming the permission
	  check on the copied-up inode wouldn't fail for root.  We don't
	  currently allow non-root to mount NFS, but there are people
	  that would like to see that change.
