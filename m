Only access/read: NFS can only be read-only layer.  So it's impossible
to actually modify a file on NFS through overlayfs.

How?

We've been through this.  We can't ask an NFS server exported
read-only about what the permission to modify the filesystem would
have been if it were exported read-write.  Sure, the protocol could be
extended, etc, etc...  But it's just not a good fit.

If someone adds the interface for access checking in the NFS client
based on server sercurity model, but without actually having to do the
request, and it works for read-only exports (which make a LOT of sense
for the use cases where overlayfs may be used with NFS) then we can
use that from overlayfs.  Last time Bruce looked this issue, he ran
away screeming, IIRC.
