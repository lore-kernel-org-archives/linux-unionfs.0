You are correct - there's no callers in my patch series that don't have a
vfsmount available. I can remove patch #2 and pass the vfsmount through.

At some point I was trying to plug this callback into audit_copy_inode()
which AFAICT doesn't have a vfsmount to pass in when we're coming from
vfs_rename (vfs_rename() -> fsnotify_move()). I will eventually have to go
back and handle this for audit though so it seems worth mentioning here.

Indeed, I agree that all of these are pretty gross and things I'd like to
see fixed - I have to deal with subvolume boundaries in some of my own
software. I know Jeff is working on some code to give subvolumes their own
vfsmount but that wouldn't help with our device reporting unless we did
something like move s_dev from the super_block to the vfsmount (also an idea
that's been thrown around).

Yeah I see now that /proc/locks isn't going to work with something calling
into ->getattr().

Primarily my concerns are /proc/*/maps and audit (which is recording ino/dev
pairs). Even though /proc/*/maps prints a path it is still a problem as
there is no way for userspace to verify that the inode it stats using that
path is the correct one.

I don't mean to overstate the case but the /proc/*/maps issue is real to us
(SUSE) in that it's produced bug reports. For example, lsof produces
confusing output when we run with a btrfs subvolume as root.

As far as problems that can't be solved by this approach - there are
tracepoints in events/lock.h and events/writeback.h which ought to be
reporting the correct ino/dev pairs. There's of course /proc/locks too. I
acknowledge that whether those are severe enough to warrant a different
approach might be up for debate.

Thanks,
