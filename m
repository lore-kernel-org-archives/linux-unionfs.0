I don't know.  I took another look at the original patch and don't see
any details on the server setup: which server is it (knfsd, ganesha,
netapp, ...)?  How is it configured?

I'm honestly not sure what's going on there.  I'd be curious to see a
network trace if possible.

I said "both", that's a logical "and".  Whether or not nfs claims
support would then be irrelevant in this case, since ext4 doesn't
support system.nfs4_acl.

Note that knfsd is an exception, most NFSv4-acl-supporting servers
aren't translating from POSIX ACLs.

Out of curiosity, how do you check permissions after copy up?

The client doesn't do much permissions-checking normally, because it's
hard to get right--even in the absence of ACLs, it may not understand
the server's owners and groups completely.

I guess that's fine, you may be happy to let people write to the file
without permissions to the lower file, since the writes aren't going
there anyway.

So, I don't know what want here.

You're not going to want to use the ACL for actual permission-checking,
and you can't modify it, so it doesn't seem very useful.
