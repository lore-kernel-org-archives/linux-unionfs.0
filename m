I am in agreement with the security model and that is what I want to
preserve. My question is if it is possible to detect that the security
can be represented by existing in-inode security features alone.

If it was up to me, I would not create the nfs4_acl xattr at the server
if it is not required and the security can be represented by existing
parameters, but it seems to be the protocol. To give a comparison, in
local filsystems, if "system.posix_acl" is not required it will not be
created.

I agree. The man page says there are features (such as alarm and audit)
which are server dependent.

I am not trying to override the security. I am trying to detect
duplication of security information. The common case of NFS
communication does not require the additional security parameters
(doesn't mean it is not required). So my question is: is it possible to
detect at the client that nfs4_acl is a duplicate of information which
can be and is represented by inode alone. If yes, can it be suppressed
by the client.
