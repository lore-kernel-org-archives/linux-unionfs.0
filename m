That's fine by me.

So man page patches will be required, too. :)

Basically, we need to nail down the expected semantics, make sure
they are correctly documented and /enforced consistently/ across all
filesystems.

Should be in the next couple of days.

You're looking at the wrong level. The VFS layer is the first
multiplexing layer, allowing filesystems to select a method of
handling functionality. They then make use of "generic helpers"
to implement the required functionality, and they contain the
required updates.

ie.g. A list of generic helpers with atime update callers from my
cscope index:

f fs/pipe.c          pipe_read                   343 file_accessed(filp);
h fs/readdir.c       iterate_dir                  56 file_accessed(file);
i fs/splice.c        generic_file_splice_read    311 file_accessed(in);
j fs/splice.c        splice_direct_to_actor      992 file_accessed(in);
p mm/filemap.c       generic_file_buffered_read 2299 file_accessed(filp);
q mm/filemap.c       generic_file_read_iter     2339 file_accessed(file);
r mm/filemap.c       generic_file_mmap          2736 file_accessed(file);

These are effectively reference implementations of the file reading
infrastructure. Filesystems often have customised implementations
but they all must contain the same functioanlity and behaviour as
the reference implementation.

Only the ones that don't specifically call the generic helper to do
the work.

IOWs, what I'd like to see is a generic_copy_file_range() as the
reference implemenation using a page cache copy. This contains all
the required checks, timestamp updates, etc. If the filesystem does
not supply ->copy_file_range, then generic_copy_file_range() is
called, not do_splice_direct(). Indeed, a filesystem should be able
to do:

	.copy_file_range = xfs_copy_file_range,

xfs_copy_file_range(...)
{
	trace_xfs_copy_file_range(...)
	return generic_copy_file_range(....);
}

and have everything work correctly.

Cheers,

Dave.
