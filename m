getfattr -m - -d nfs/folder -e text gives

# file: nfs/folder/
system.nfs4_acl="\000\000\000^C\000\000\000\000\000\000\000\000\000^V^A<E7>\000\000\000^FOWNER@\000\000\000\000\000\000\000\000\000\000\000^R\000<A1>\000\000\000^FGROUP@\000\000\000\000\000\000\000\000\000\000\000^R\000<A1>\000\000\000
    EVERYONE@\000\000"

Those are 80 bytes. I checked again and vfs_getxattr indeed returns size=80.
It just looked empty because the first byte is 0... Ok, so nfs4_acl is not
empty after all and checking *value == 0 does not tell if there are actually
ACLs present or not, sorry for the confusion.

You are right, when I mount the exported fs with noacl the problem goes away.
You already helped me there, thanks.

Still, I think there should be a way to copy up files that actually have no
ACLs since acl is often the default for ext4 mounts and giving an "Operation
not supported" for random open(2)s is not a very good way to convey what's
going on.
