Actually we could allow changes on the server side.   Overlayfs sort
of does this already (calls underlying fs's ->d_revalidate() from
ovl_dentry_revalidate()).  What's still needed is to detect rename by
rechecking parent and d_name to match overlay dentry's parent and
d_name.

But a shared block dev could be used in most cases, I guess.
