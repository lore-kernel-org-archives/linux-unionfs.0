We should definitely have clear documentation, but despite that, in
practice lots of people *will* be surprised when permissions are
enforced differently after copy-up, and those surprises may well have
unpleasant implications.

And the differences will depend on details of the server implementation,
which makes documenting the behavior and giving people the correct
expectations that much more complicated.

Why is that?  There are a *lot* of Linux clients out there talking to
non-knfsd servers.  I wouldn't have thought knfsd is even a
majority--but of course it depends very much on what kind of use exactly
we're measuring.  And I don't have any numbers.
