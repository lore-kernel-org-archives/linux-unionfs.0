Let's see: root squashing will change root creds to nobody's creds, right?

That results in a weird situation, where user foo is trying to access
a file owned by foo, but which doesn't have read permission for
"other" will not be able to perform a read on that file.  In fact, no
user will be able to read that file, including root.   Copying up the
file will also fail, since that requires read permission.

So for that case it's not true that permission will change, since
copy-up won't be possible.

That leaves the case where no read or write permissions are involved,
which is execute.  I think we should just mask that out from the
inode_permission() check.  Makes no sense to ask underlying filesystem
about execute permission.   With that we'll have consistent
permissions before and after copy-up.  Right?

Thanks,
Miklos
