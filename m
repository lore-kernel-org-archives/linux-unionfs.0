Which callers would those be?  I don't see anything in your series that
wouldn't have vfsmount at hand...

btrfs pulling odd crap with device numbers is a problem, but this is far from
the most obvious unpleasantness caused by that - e.g. userland code expecting
that unequal st_dev for directory and subdirectory means that we have
a mountpoint there.  Or assuming it can compare that to st_dev of mountpoints
(or, indeed, the values in /proc/self/mountinfo) to find which fs it's on...

/proc/*/maps is unfortunate, but it does contain the pathnames, doesn't it?
What _real_ problems are there - the ones where we don't have a saner solution?
Note that /proc/locks is (a) FPOS interface and (b) unsuitable for your
approach anyway.
