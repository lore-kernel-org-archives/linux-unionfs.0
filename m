It's not hard to come up with a heuristic that determines if a
system.nfs4_acl value is equivalent to a file mode, and to ignore the
attribute in that case. (The file mode is transmitted in its own
attribute already, so actually converting .) That way, overlayfs could
still fail copying up files that have an actual ACL. It's still an
ugly hack ...
