You have a point there.  I think current code can be inconsistent like
that.  But that's only because it doesn't stack file operations.
Stacking f_ops is now queued up for 4.18, which means that *all* calls
into underlying layers should be with the same creds (those of the
mounting task), regardless of the creds of the task performing the
operation.

So if NFS server is denying read to mounter (because of root squashing
or for other reason), then that file will not be accessible from
overlayfs by anyone and will not be in the cache either.  If access to
mounter is allowed, then the access will be based on local DAC.

Look at ovl_permission(), I think it pretty clearly describes this model.

Thanks,
Miklos
