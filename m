Special file can get copied up on metadata change.  We shoudln't ask
server at all for permissions in this case.  That would be consistent
with the "cp -a" model.

The "cp -a" model should work even for userns unprivileged mounts.  We
do assume a certain sanity with setups: I'm sure someone could come up
with a setup (e.g. with selinux) where weirdness happens after
copy-up.
