No, that's not possible.

The user's identity could be mapped in various ways.  You've got no way
to know whether root squashing is in effect, for example.  Or to know
what the user@EXAMPLE.COM krb5 identity that you're running as might map
to on the server.

So it's hard to even tell whether a given user matches the file's owner
or group.  So even the mode bits are kind of meaningless to the client.
