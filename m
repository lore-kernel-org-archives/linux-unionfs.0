Fine, but why are we seeing this xattr on exports where no xattrs are
set on the exported fs?

Right.

This does explain the nfs4_acl xattr on the client.  Question: if it's
empty, why have it at all?

Basically that's what happens now.  The problem is that nfsv4 mounts
seem always have these xattrs, even when the exported fs doesn't have
anything.

We could do the copy up even if the NFS4->POSIX translation was
possible (which is the case with POSIX ACL translated by knfsd).  We'd
just get back the original ACL, so that's OK.  NFS is only supported
as lower (read-only) layer, so we don't care about changing the ACL on
the server.

Thanks,
Miklos
