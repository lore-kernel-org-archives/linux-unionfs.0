dentry evaluations and inode lookups are done by overlayfs, with the 
help of NFS. NFS becomes a subset of overlayfs. However, you are right. 
state recovery will break with this patch.

Which makes me wonder: Shouldn't nfs_open_context (or any open context) 
be with respect to an inode as opposed to a dentry?
