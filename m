I understand.  Ignoring nfs4_acl in overlayfs will have the same
result as adding noacl to the underlying NFS mount.

It's the only sane model that overlayfs can do.

Think of it this way:  creating an image file on NFS, formating it to
ext4 and mounting it locally through the loop device is not going to
be compatible with the NFS security model either.  Should we care?
